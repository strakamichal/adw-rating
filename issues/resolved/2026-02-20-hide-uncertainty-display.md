- **Type**: improvement
- **Priority**: medium
- **Status**: open

## Description

The rating uncertainty (sigma) value is currently displayed alongside ratings. User feedback suggests this is visually noisy and not useful for most visitors. Consider removing or hiding it from the default view.

## Where to look

- Rankings page — rating display
- Competitor profile page — rating display
- Any other place where uncertainty/sigma is shown

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Rating uncertainty is not shown by default in rankings and profiles
